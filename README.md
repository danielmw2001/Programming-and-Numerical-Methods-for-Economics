# Programming-and-Numerical-Methods-for-Economics, All coursework Graded as a First (top grade bracket)
This folder contains some of my coursework completed in Python with a partener for the Programming for Economics Module. It contains the following Jupyter notebook files.

## Optimisation Methods on Rosenbrock and Maximum Likelihood funcitons
Manually programmed and implemented various constrained optimistion algorithms, including Newton's sequential quadtratic programming algorithm, the penalty method, augmented lagrangian method and parameter transformation. Used and compared effectiveness of these methods to fit maximum likelihood model for labour force data estimation based on NLSY79

## Function Approximation
Experimented with and compared effectiveness of different interpolation methods including: Chebyshev polynomials, Lagrange polynomials, linear interpolation, and cubic splines on various functions. Combined with optimisation methods from previous lab to solve various economic models.

## Value function iteration
Combined simluation and interpolation methods with value and policy function iteration to solve various economic models, and compare each methods effectiveness

## Macroeconomics and Inequality in Uganda
Cleaned, visualised and did preliminary analysis on economic panel data from Uganda.

## Simulation Methods and Random Variables
Used simulation methods, including monte-carlo simulation, to simulate the effect of policy changes within an economic model, prove asymptotic normality of OLS and experiment with binomial and poisson distribtions.
